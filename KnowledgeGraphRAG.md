# Knowledge Graph RAG: Beyond Simple Vector Search

## Why Knowledge Graph RAG?

Traditional RAG approaches face several limitations:
- Difficulty handling multi-hop questions
- Loss of global context due to document chunking
- Limited ability to connect related information
- Redundant information in search results

Knowledge Graph RAG addresses these issues by combining the semantic capabilities of LLMs with the structured relationships of knowledge graphs.

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Context Representation**
   - Natural representation of relationships between entities
   - Preservation of global context
   - Ability to traverse related concepts

2. **Enhanced Query Capabilities**
   - Support for multi-hop questions
   - Combination of semantic and structural search
   - More precise and relevant answers

3. **Flexible Data Integration**
   - Mix of structured and unstructured data
   - Dynamic knowledge graph construction using LLMs
   - Better handling of temporal and hierarchical data

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. LLM-powered Graph Construction
- Use LLMs to extract entities and relationships from documents
- Automatically build and update the knowledge graph
- Validate and refine relationships through LLM reasoning

### 2. Hybrid Search Strategies
- Combine vector similarity search with graph traversal
- Use LLM to generate graph queries (e.g., Cypher for Neo4j)
- Weight results based on both semantic similarity and graph distance

### 3. Context-Aware Response Generation
- Gather context through graph traversal
- Use LLM to synthesize information from multiple nodes
- Maintain consistency through graph structure

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Identify key entities and relationships in your domain
   - Define schema for knowledge graph
   - Prepare documents for entity extraction

2. **Graph Construction**
   - Extract entities using LLM
   - Build relationships between entities
   - Validate graph structure

3. **Query Processing**
   - Implement hybrid search strategy
   - Define traversal patterns for different query types
   - Fine-tune response generation

## Next Steps

- [ ] Evaluate existing knowledge graph tools
- [ ] Design initial graph schema for our use case
- [ ] Test entity extraction with current LLM
- [ ] Implement proof of concept with small dataset

## Notes

This approach seems particularly well-suited for our sprint documentation case as it could:
- Naturally represent sprint relationships and hierarchies
- Better handle temporal aspects of sprints
- Connect related activities across different sprints
- Provide more context-aware responses
